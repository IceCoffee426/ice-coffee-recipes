# Iced Coffee Recipes

A recipes website: the first project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinporject.com)'s HTML and CSS course. As I have learnt more about web design, I have practiced on it and added more. [Live preview](https://icecoffee426.github.io/ice-coffee-recipes).

## Description

I learnt how to use Flexbox and various other CSS properties when I first made this. As I learnt more CSS and JavaScript, I came back and added more to it by making it responsive, adding form validation, an image carousel and a multi-level nav menu. I really enjoyed making this page (simple as it is) because it taught me some important principles of web design.
